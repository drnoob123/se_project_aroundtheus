# Practicum Project Around The U.S.

This is a project from Practicum of the Web Development program. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. Photos have been optimized using "TinyPng" (https://tinypng.com/).
